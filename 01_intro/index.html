<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : ENHANCED JEWELRY BOX</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Inspired by my own jewelry organizer, I want to build a jewelry holder with automatically rotating hooks. When I want a specific necklace, I can press a button or remote that selects the corresponding hook, releases the jewelry into a collection tray, and extends the collection tray out to deliver the desired necklace to me.

<h4>Idea 2: TEMPERATURE SENSING ARM</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

This project is a prosthetic arm that is able to detect temperature and notify the user if something is too hot or too cold. The LED lights on the fingers become red if the object is hot or blue if the object is cold. Based on the intensity of how hot or cold the object is, a certain number of LEDs will light up.

<h4>Idea 3: PLAY BY AIR </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Inspired by the theremin, this will be a 3 part musical instrument played by air. The user will wear finger gloves containing sensor technology that interacts with the sensors in each of the 3 compartments. Each compartment represents a different instrument: piano, drums, bass. The idea is that each compartment requires different finger movements to create the sound (drum: more rapid hitting movements, piano: more fluid finger movements). Each of the 3 sounds will then be layered together to create music.
